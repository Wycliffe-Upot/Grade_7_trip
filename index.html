    <h2><u>Day One</u></h2>
    <p>As we approached the renowned Great Rift Valley Viewpoint, our expectations of enjoying the breathtaking panoramic views were dampened by thick fog that had engulfed the entire region. Normally a picturesque stop that offers sweeping sights of the valley’s lakes, mountains, and farmland, the fog denied us the opportunity to take in this natural wonder. Despite this, the learners remained in high spirits.
<p>To ensure road safety, our travel pace slowed significantly. The misty conditions had already led to multiple accidents along the route, causing heavy traffic snarl-ups, which further delayed our journey. We eventually made a stopover at Salgaa at 2:32 PM, where we took a well-deserved lunch break for about an hour.</p>
<p>We resumed our journey and arrived at Fort Ternan at 5:10 PM. The Fort Ternan Prehistoric Site, nestled deep in the lush greenery of the highlands, presented its own unique logistical challenge. The narrow, rocky all-weather access road—with its winding turns, steep climbs, and gentle slopes—was unsuitable for our large bus. We had to resort to using the smaller school bus to ferry the learners in two groups.</p>
<p>Despite the detour and terrain, the visit to Fort Ternan was deeply rewarding. Learners were thrilled to witness the historical site and see structures and fossils identical to those in their Social Studies textbooks — a powerful "learning beyond the classroom" moment. The hands-on experience brought the past to life, sparking curiosity and excitement among the pupils, many of whom were over the moon to finally match theory with reality.
We spent approximately one and a half hours at the site, making the most of every moment before continuing our journey to Kisumu.</p>
<p>We embarked on the final 72-kilometre stretch to Kisumu, darkness slowly crept in, casting long shadows over the winding road. The journey became more demanding, with a 20-kilometre potholed section, where we had to navigate carefully alongside slow-moving tractors transporting sugarcane to the nearby Muhoroni Sugar factory. Despite the delays, the excitement among the learners remained undimmed.</p>
<p>We eventually arrived at our hotel in Kisumu at 9:00 PM to a warm welcome. The learners were visibly fired up with excitement at finally reaching the vibrant lakeside city. Their faces lit up even more when they spotted the school principal already at the hotel, waiting to receive them with open arms.</p>
<p>After a heartfelt opening prayer, the group was taken through a brief orientation and room allocation process. Laughter and chatter filled the air as pupils settled into their new surroundings. We then gathered together for a well-deserved supper, reflecting on the days adventures and preparing for the learning opportunities that awaited in the coming days.
The day had been long and filled with unexpected twists, but the spirit of the learners, teachers, and staff remained high, proving that every step of the journey was part of the experience — a true moment of learning beyond the classroom.</p>

    <h2><u>Day Two</u></h2>
    <p>After a late and exhausting arrival, learners were allowed extra rest to recover. They would wake up at 8:00 AM, have breakfast, then gather for devotion and a briefing before beginning today’s educational activities with renewed energy.</p>
